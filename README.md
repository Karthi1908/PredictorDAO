Proposal has an option to define two types of voting 1. Based on Vote and 2. Based on Stake(coin voting) ( resultType field controls the option)
if result type is selected as Vote - result will be declared based on the count of individuals voted ( 1 person has 1 vote)
if result type is selected as Stake - result will be declared based on the amount of tokens each individuals hold (1 token is 1 vote) So aperson with 200 tokens voted for proposal means 200 voted are polled for that option.
